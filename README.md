# Responsive Web Design: Practice

## Intro
This site follows a mobile-first design where it was designed primarily to fit on a mobile device. 

## Task
* Use Media Queries and Responsive Typography to make this website fit better on larger devices
* **Write your code in `style.css`**
* Test out your code by resizing the width of the preview window
            
## Ideas
* Idea 1: When there is enough room, make section1 and section2 go side-by-side. Given that section2 has more content, give it more room than section1.
* Idea 2: Make the font sizes responsive to the width of the device
* Idea 3: Use multiple breakpoints to make this site fit all size devices!
